A few hours later, I was at the <a href=\"https://boxshopsf.org/\">Box Shop</a>, meeting that blogpost’s ‘big art’ proponent!</p>\n<p>Touching steel is the new touching grass. I spent the evening reshaping and cutting wire into the shapes of eight bird tails. I’m very grateful to the stalwarts who showed me around. I can’t wait to go back for more training this week!</p>\n<p>The Bay Area Rapid Transport network is so far from anything I could reconstruct, teleported back to the year 1850, that I don’t mind it all that much.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://lydianottingham.substack.com/p/the-box-shop\">Substack</a></em></p>"
