This morning, [Malaika](https://malaikaaiyar.me/) shared ‘[how to be happy in San Francisco’](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/how-to-be-happy-in-san-francisco?curius=5402). A few hours later, I was at the [Box Shop](https://boxshopsf.org/), meeting that blogpost’s ‘big art’ proponent!

Touching steel is the new touching grass. I spent the evening reshaping and cutting wire into the shapes of eight bird tails. I’m very grateful to the stalwarts who showed me around. I can’t wait to go back for more training this week!

The Bay Area Rapid Transport network is so far from anything I could reconstruct, teleported back to the year 1850, that I don’t mind it all that much.
