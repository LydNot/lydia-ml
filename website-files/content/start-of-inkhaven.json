  "content": "<h1>Start of Inkhaven!</h1>\n\n<p>Hi! <a href=\"https://www.inkhaven.blog/\">Inkhaven</a> starts today, &amp; I figured I should pull together a quick post explaining what that means for the blog, plus setting intentions for the month.</p>\n<p>All posts will be crossposted to <a href=\"https://lydia.ml/\">lydia.ml</a>.</p>\n<h4>Embrace conversational writing!</h4>\n<p>When I was scoping out ‘GiveWell of AI Safety’ for <a href=\"https://manifund.com/\">Manifund</a> earlier this year, one of the first things I did was write a <a href=\"https://manifund.substack.com/p/givewell-for-ai-safety-lessons-learned\">blogpost</a>.</p>\n<p>The first draft took me ~2 days. I showed it to <a href=\"https://blog.austn.io/\">Austin</a>, whose feedback was “minor edits, but otherwise good to go!” </p>\n<p>I wasn’t satisfied and went back to the drawing board. One week later, I had a significantly more polished draft. I showed <em>this</em> to Austin and his feedback was “hmm…I think I liked the first version better!”</p>\n<p>Now, when I reread, I too prefer the first version. Readers do get a lot of value out of half-formed notes—see e.g. <a href=\"https://guzey.com/what-im-thinking-about/#appendix-2021-02-25-concerns\">representative Guzey drop</a>. </p>\n<p>Since then, I’ve been trying to publish my initial forward-pass more often.</p>\n<h4>I want to do lots of technical writing…</h4>\n<p>I read lots of ML papers, and I want to write about these—ideally including notes from follow-up experiments. I get lots of value from reading others’ paper summaries, so I’m happy to put more out into the world.</p>\n<p>These will live under the <a href=\"https://lydianottingham.substack.com/s/posts-about-ai\">AI/ML tab</a> (I considered setting up another publication, but I think tags work for now. The content is what matters).</p>\n<p>Also, since <a href=\"https://lydia.ml/essay?post=beware-the-delmore-effect-\">Beware the Delmore Effect</a>, I’ve become more…open-minded. This means there might be indulgent detours into other technical topics as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How much compute would it take to simulate humans at varying levels of granularity? (inspired by Type-0 risks in <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf\">VWH</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What actually is going on in neuromodulation? What’s the state of <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241008878282/en/Breakthrough-from-REMspace-First-Ever-Communication-Between-People-in-Dreams?curius=3971\">injecting messages directly into the brain</a>?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What would putting longevity on the <a href=\"https://www.gap-map.org/?sort=rank\">Gap Map</a> look like?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The future of human labor: how I changed my mind about humanity’s ‘skill issue’ (ft. <a href=\"https://gradual-disempowerment.ai/\">Kulveit et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w32255\">Korinek and Suh</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>…the Delmore Effect strikes again.</p>\n<h4>I’ll go to Constellation (&amp; Boston, Toronto)</h4>\n<p>I plan to spend 17-21 Nov at <a href=\"https://www.constellation.org/\">Constellation</a>. I’ll offer to scribe people’s thoughts that haven’t made their way into the world yet. If you know anyone there who might appreciate or benefit from this, please let me know!</p>\n<p>I’ll spend 6-10 Nov in the Boston area and 10-11 Nov in Toronto. I may yet be persuaded to visit more of Canada (discovering Canadian AI research (Mila, Vector Institute, UAlberta(!)) has been exciting recently).</p>\n<h4>On slow days, there’ll be more personal posts</h4>\n<p>Here are some in the works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Real life doesn’t come with dependency conflict warnings</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two types of homeostasis</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do you love your field or yourself?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reducing your susceptibility to infohazards</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Three weird, replicable social moves</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tier list of things postponed to post-singularity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why people resist specializing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Nonperishable Agenda</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can email me at hello@lydia.ml to vote for any of these :) I have also set up a <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/LydiaNottingham/which-of-these-blogposts-will-i-pub\">market</a> where you can vote on which is most likely to happen (and, by doing so, increase the likelihood that it does).</p>\n<p>(Betting ‘yes’ on all, then holding me to it, is probably easy money!)</p>\n<p>…the Delmore Effect strikes <em>again</em>.</p>\n<p>See you more often :) </p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://lydianottingham.substack.com/p/start-of-inkhaven\">Substack</a></em></p>"
