It tasted very bad, and while it might be edible, I wouldn’t recommend this. </p>\n<p>I talked to ChatGPT a bit and decided to turn it into a face mask. I’ve never done this before. I was pretty surprised to hear that the skin can ‘absorb’ fatty acids and Vitamin E: if the skin can really absorb what sits on it (outside specialized medical contexts), wouldn’t doing e.g. mud runs be dangerous? But apparently the skin absorbs ‘small, fat-soluble molecules’ and not ‘big or water-soluble molecules’.</p>\n<p>Apparently there’s an entire science of the delightfully named ‘percutaneous absorption’. From the avocado, Vitamin E/a few fatty acids make it past the ‘stratum corneum’ (outermost layer) into the epidermis, but very little (perhaps just a trace amount of oleic acid) makes it to the dermis, let alone the bloodstream.</p>\n<p>The science of transdermal absorption (absorption all the way to the bloodstream) seems pretty interesting, too, and underlies e.g. nerve agents.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lydianottingham.substack.com/p/avocado-experiment/comments\">2</a>1</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://lydianottingham.substack.com/p/avocado-experiment\">Substack</a></em></p>"
